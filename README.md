# PiPortfolioDaemon

This is a work in progess.

- It is a NodeJS server that watches a shared SAMBA folder for files. 
- If files are detected it tries to send them via [rpfolio](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/transfolio) to the Atari Portfolio.

The [daemon_min.js]() is already working as a proof of concept. I am now trying to buld a web interface for additional functionality.
